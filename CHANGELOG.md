# Changelog

All notable changes to AnyDoor are documented here. This project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and uses semantic
versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- QR code recognition: drag-select a screen region to decode any QR codes
  inside it. Payload is copied to the clipboard verbatim; multiple codes
  are newline-joined top-to-bottom. The toast reports status only and
  never includes the decoded content. New "识别二维码" panel row with an
  assignable global hotkey.

### Changed

- Removed the user-tunable update-check frequency setting; Sparkle now
  uses its default schedule.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- App failed to launch from `/Applications` because the bundled
  `Sparkle.framework` was not on dyld's search path. The release script now
  injects `@executable_path/../Frameworks` into the main executable's rpath
  before codesigning.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Auto-update via Sparkle 2 with assets published to GitHub Releases.
- "关于与更新" section in General settings.
- Menu bar panel banner when a new version is available.

### Changed

- Lowered the minimum supported macOS version to 14.0 (Sonoma) while keeping
  Liquid Glass effects on macOS 26+ only. OCR now uses the legacy
  VNRecognizeTextRequest path, and Settings falls back to the classic
  TabView/tabItem API.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-23

- Initial release.
